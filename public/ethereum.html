            <h3>Ethereum</h3><br><br>
            <p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. The platform also supports the creation of other cryptocurrencies or tokens, using its ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. <br><br>
            One of the key features of Ethereum is its ability to execute smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts allow for decentralized applications to be built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling a wide range of use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, digital identity management, and more. <br><br>
            Ethereum uses a consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the network. It is currently undergoing a major upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which will introduce significant changes to its architecture, including the transition to a more energy-efficient PoS consensus algorithm and the integration of sharding to increase network scalability. <br><br>
            Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network, designed to address some of the scalability and sustainability issues of the current Ethereum architecture. The upgrade involves several key changes, including the transition from the current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to a more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm called the Beacon Chain. <br><br>
            The Beacon Chain is the backbone of the new Ethereum 2.0 network and is responsible for coordinating and validating transactions across the network. Validators stake their Ether to participate in the consensus process and are rewarded for maintaining the integrity of the network. The PoS consensus algorithm is designed to be more energy-efficient than the PoW algorithm, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network. <br><br>
            Another major change in Ethereum 2.0 is the introduction of sharding, which is a technique for partitioning the network into smaller, more manageable segments called shards. Each shard will have its own set of validators and will be able to process transactions in parallel, increasing the network's overall scalability. <br><br>
            The upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 is being rolled out in phases, with the first phase focused on the launch of the Beacon Chain and the transition to PoS consensus. This was completed in December 2020, and since then, the Ethereum 2.0 network has been running in parallel with the existing Ethereum network. The next phase of the upgrade will introduce shard chains and is currently in development. Overall, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to bring significant improvements to the Ethereum network, including increased scalability, improved security, and reduced energy consumption, making it more sustainable in the long run.</p><br><br><br><br>
